# Kustomer Extension for Magento 2.x
This extension allows publication of Magento events to Kustomer. It provides a `KustomerEventObserver` class that you can extend to publish events to your Kustomer account.

## Development Software
Note that this extension is still under active development and should not be considered suitable for production Magento stores.

## Installation
1. Place the contents of this repo into the following path relative to your store's root installation folder `app/code/Kustomer/KustomerIntegration`
2. In Magento admin disable cache by going to `System>>Cache Management`
3. From the root of your magento installation run:
```shell
php Â­f bin/magento setup:upgrade
```
4. Reopen your Magento admin and go to `Stores>>Configuration>>Customers`. A new option called `Kustomer` should be visible.
5. Don't forget to re-enable your cache!

### Setup
Use of this extension requires an active Kustomer subscription. More information about Kustomer can be found on our [website](https://www.kustomer.com).

For now, Magento integration must be enabled manually by our CX team, though you will later be able to install the app from the App Directory when development is complete.

Once Magento is enabled on your Kustomer account, you need to create an API key so your Magento store can send data to Kustomer. In the Kustomer app, go to `Settings>>API Keys`. Create a key here with the role `org.user` and keep a copy of the key handy. You will need it.

Next, go to your Magento store's admin site and navigate to `Store>>Configuration>>Customers>>Kustomer` (if the `Kustomer` option is not available, see the installation instructions above). Select the store/website you want to integrate with Kustomer (or stay in the default scope if you want to use the integration globally). Enter the API key you generated in Kustomer into the API Key box and make sure the `Enabled` option is set to `Yes`. Next, select any of the default events you want to broadcast to Kustomer (such as when a new Customer is created) and click `Save`. You should be all set!

### Pausing the Extension
If you want to stop sending data to Kustomer, you can turn off the extension at any time by returning to the settings page and setting the `Enabled` value to `No`. Note that any data collected while the extension is off will not be sent to Kustomer.  

## Custom Events and Objects
While the Kustomer Extension comes with a few pre-made events (new customers, orders, etc.), it is possible to send add your own custom events to Kustomer. To do this, create your own module and make sure `kustomer/kustomer-integration` is one of the requirements in `composer.json`. For more information about creating Magento Modules, see the [Magento Developer Documentation](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/extension-dev-guide/bk-extension-dev-guide.html). 

Then create an Observer under `Observers/MySubscriptionObserver.php` and extend the `KustomerEventObserver` class. If you wanted to send a custom Subscription object to Kustomer when it is created, you might do something like this:

```php
<?php

namespace MyCompany\MyModule\Observer;

use Kustomer\KustomerIntegration\Observer\KustomerEventObserver;
use Magento\Framework\Event\Observer as EventObserver;

class MySubscriptionObserver extends KustomerEventObserver
{
    /**
     * @param EventObserver $observer
     */
    public function execute(EventObserver $observer)
    {
        $subscription = $observer->getEvent()->getOrder();
        $customer = $subscription->getCustomer();

        $type = 'subscription';
        $data = array(
            'plan' => $subscription->getPlan(),
            'term' => $subscription->getTerm(),
            'period_start' => $subscription->getPeriodStart(),
            'period_end' => $subscription->getPeriodEnd()  
        );
        $this->publish($type, $data, $customer);
    }
}
```
Note that the `KustomerEventObserver.publish()` method requires a `$type` string, an array of `$data` (this is will be your object in Kustomer) and a `customer` object.

We also recommend you explicitly select which fields you send to Kustomer. This will avoid inadvertently sharing information you may not want to share with Kustomer, such as passwords.

Once your observer is ready, you need to register it in your module's `etc/events.xml` file. This example might look like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:Event/etc/events.xsd">
    <event name="subscription_create_success">
        <observer name="my_subscription_observer" instance="MyCompany\MyModule\Observer\MySubscriptionObserver" />
    </event>
</config>
```

Subscription objects will automatically be ingested by Kustomer and associated with your customer as Kustom Objects belonging to a dynamically-generated Klass.
